# Policies

## Safety and Security

All life forms, regardless of their age, gender or upbringing are welcomed at MoneroKon.

We are dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable experience for everybody attending our events, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, race, physical appearance or disability. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. We don't tolerate life forms who refuse to share this openness towards others.

The MoneroKon will always be a place where people can enjoy technology and culture, no matter what their background is. To keep it that way: If someone is misbehaving and you want support, let a MoneroKon volunteer know, they will be glad to help.

## Photo Policy

Ask before snapping, all persons in a photo/video must have explicitly given consent to be photographed/recorded. As such, please avoid taking photos/video of large crowds, audience, or workshop participants.

## Chat Moderation

Chat moderation policy is primarily based on Libera.Chat’s Network Policies/Guidelines and Matrix Code of Conduct. The policy can be found [here](https://github.com/MoneroKon/meta/blob/main/policies/chat-mod.md).

## Sponsor Policy

To ensure clarity and openness in the sponsorship selection process, we have formalized a sponsor policy, which be found [here](https://github.com/MoneroKon/meta/blob/main/policies/sponsorship-policy.md).

## Privacy Policy

We aim to minimize the collection of personal data used for processing orders and communicating event announcements. After the event, we delete the data. More details can be found [here](/privacy).

## Ticket Refund Policy

All sales are final, no refunds. The 'right of withdrawal' does not apply to contracts for cultural and sporting events scheduled on specific dates.
