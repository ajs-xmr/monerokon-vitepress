Monero is the leading cryptocurrency focused on private and censorship-resistant transactions. The majority of existing cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have transparent blockchains, where all wallet addresses and balances are viewable in a public ledger. Monero, on the other hand, encrypts this information by design and by default with the use of various privacy-enhancing technologies to protect the personal data of its users.
